The changes you have made to the notebook *will be lost* when your session ends (which is when you close the window, or the patience of the service has expired). Thus, the interactive exploration of the notebooks is good to help learn Python, computing and data science, but you should not attempt to write any code in these notebooks that you want to re-use the next day or later."
